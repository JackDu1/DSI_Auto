Any such onsite consultation would be pursuant to a services agreement as agreed upon by the parties.
 
(d)	Customer shall have access to Quest's Support Web site at http://support.quest.com ("SupportLink").

(f)	During Business Hours, Quest will respond within one (1) hour to a call from Customer which reports a critical Software condition (a "Severity Level 1 Problem"). Customer must use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Quest with the necessary remote access to facilitate the identification and resolution of a Severity Level 1 Problem.  Quest's ability to identify and resolve a Severity Level 1 Problem may be delayed without such remote access. 

(g)	The Maintenance Services for those Software products that Quest has obtained through an acquisition or merger may, for a period of time following the effective date of the acquisition or merger, be governed by terms other than those in this Section 10.  The applicable different terms, if any, shall be stated on SupportLink.

11.  	Warranties.  

(a)	Software Warranty. Quest warrants that, for a period of thirty (30) days following the initial delivery of Software pursuant to an Order (the "Warranty Period"), (i) the media provided by Quest, if any, on which the Software is recorded will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship under normal use, (ii) the operation of the Software, as provided by Quest, will substantially conform to the Documentation applicable to such Software, and (iii) the Software as delivered by Quest does not contain any viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, or other malicious or destructive code designed by Quest to allow unauthorized intrusion upon, disabling of, or erasure of the Software (however, the Software may contain a key limiting use of the Software to within the scope of License granted, and license keys issued by Quest for temporary use are time-sensitive) (the "Warranties"). Customer must give written notice to Quest of any breach of the Warranties no later than five days following the expiration of the Warranty Period.  

Customer's exclusive remedies, and Quest's sole obligations, for any such breach of these Warranties shall be as follows: (a) for the warranty in subsection (i), Quest shall, at its expense, replace any defective media; (b) for the warranty in subsection (ii), Quest shall correct or provide a workaround for reproducible errors in the Software that cause a breach of the warranty within a reasonable time considering the severity of the error and its effect on Customer, or, at Quest's option, refund the license fees paid for the nonconforming Software upon return of such Software to Quest and termination of the related License(s) hereunder; and (c) for the warranty in subsection (iii), Quest shall provide a copy of the Software that is in conformance with such warranty. 

The foregoing Warranties shall not apply to any non-conformance (i) that Quest cannot recreate after exercising commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to do so; (ii) caused by misuse of the Software or by using the Software in a manner that is inconsistent with this Agreement or the Documentation; or (iii) arising from the modification of the Software by anyone other than Quest. 

(b)	Hardware Warranty. Hardware shall be warranted in accordance with the warranty document delivered with the Hardware and/or included on the hardware manufacturers' website. In the event Customer acquires Hardware that is delivered with a third party warranty ("Third Party Warranty"), Customer will rely solely on the applicable third party for all Third Party Warranty obligations. 

(c)	Warranty Disclaimer. THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES PROVIDED BY QUEST HEREUNDER. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR REMEDIES ARE EXCLUDED, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE. QUEST DOES NOT WARRANT UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OPERATION OF THE PRODUCTS.

12.  Infringement.  Quest will at its own expense defend or settle any claim, suit, action, or proceeding brought against Customer by a third party to the extent it is based on an allegation that the Software directly infringes any patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right enforceable in the country in which the Software is delivered to Customer, or misappropriates a trade secret in such country (a "Claim").  Additionally, Quest shall pay any judgments finally awarded against Customer under a Claim or any amounts assessed against Customer in any settlements of a Claim, and reasonable administrative costs or expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, necessarily incurred by Customer in responding to the Claim. Quest's obligations under this Section are conditioned upon Customer (i) giving prompt written notice of the Claim to Quest; (ii) permitting Quest to retain sole control of the investigation, defense or settlement of the Claim, and (iii) providing Quest with such cooperation and assistance as Quest may reasonably request from time to time in connection with the investigation, defense or settlement of the Claim. Quest shall have no obligation hereunder to defend Customer against any Claim (a) resulting from use of the Software other than as authorized in this Agreement, (b) resulting from a modification of the Software other than by Quest, or (c) based on Customer's use of the Software after Quest recommends discontinuation because of possible or actual infringement, (d) based on Customer's use of a superseded or altered release of Software if the infringement would have been avoided by use of a current or unaltered release of the Software made available to Customer, or (e) to the extent the Claim arises from or is based on the use of the Software with other products, services, or data not supplied by Quest if the infringement would not have occurred but for such use. If Customer's use of the Software is enjoined as a result of a Claim, Quest shall, at its expense and option either (i) obtain for Customer the right to continue using the Software, (ii) replace the Software with a functionally equivalent non-infringing product, (iii) modify the Software so that it is non-infringing, or (iv) accept the return of the infringing Software and refund the license fee paid for the infringing Software, pro-rated over a sixty (60) month period from the date of delivery of the Software following an  Order. This Section states the entire liability of Quest, and Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, with respect to a Claim.

FOR MAINTENANCE SERVICES OR A PRODUCT SUBJECT TO RECURRING FEES, THE LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID AND/OR OWED (AS APPLICABLE) FOR SUCH MAINTENANCE SERVICE OR PRODUCT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE BREACH.

Quest's Affiliates and suppliers shall be beneficiaries of this "Limitation of Liability" section and Customer's Service Providers are entitled to the rights granted under the "Third Party Use" section of this Agreement; otherwise, no third party beneficiaries exist under this Agreement. Quest expressly excludes any and all liability to Customer's Service Providers, Clients and to any other third party.

14.  Nondisclosure. "Confidential Information" means information or materials disclosed by one party (the "Disclosing Party") to the other party (the "Receiving Party") that are not generally available to the public and which, due to their character and nature, a reasonable person under like circumstances would treat as confidential, including, without limitation, the Disclosing Party's personal data, financial information, marketing information, trade secrets, know-how, proprietary tools, proprietary knowledge and proprietary methodologies. Confidential Information of Quest further includes this Agreement, the Products (in source code and/or object code form), the pricing and discounting offered by Quest to Customer hereunder, information regarding the functionality and performance of the Products, benchmark test results regarding the Products, and any Software license keys provided to Customer.

Additionally, it shall not be a breach of this Section for the Receiving Party to disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as may be required by operation of law or legal process, provided that the Receiving Party provides prior notice of such disclosure to the Disclosing Party unless expressly prohibited from doing so by a court, arbitration panel or other legal authority of competent jurisdiction. The Receiving Party shall not (1) make the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information available to any Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants or representatives (collectively, the "Representatives") who do not have a "need to know" in order to carry out the purposes of this Agreement; (2) otherwise disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to any third party without the written consent of the Disclosing Party; or (3) use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information for any purpose other than as contemplated by this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall inform its Representatives of the confidential nature of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information and the requirements regarding restrictions on disclosure and use as set forth in this Section and shall disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information only to its Representatives who are legally bound to protect the Confidential Information under terms at least as restrictive as those provided herein. The Receiving Party agrees to protect the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure by exercising at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own similar information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. The Receiving Party shall be liable to the Disclosing Party for any disclosure or other breach in violation of this Agreement by any of its Representatives. The Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party of any known unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information and will cooperate with the Disclosing Party in any litigation brought by the Disclosing Party against third parties to protect its proprietary rights.

The Report shall contain data sufficient to verify Customer's deployment of the Products within the quantities, Product Terms, and maintenance release to which it is entitled. Customer will permit Quest to review Customer's deployment and use of the Products for compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any such reviews shall be scheduled at least fifteen (15) days in advance, shall be conducted during normal business hours at Customer's facilities, and shall not unreasonably interfere with Customer's business activities.  If Customer's deployment of the Products is found to be greater than contracted for Customer will be invoiced for the additional deployment and the unpaid fees shall be payable in accordance with this Agreement. Additionally, if the unpaid fees exceed five percent (5%) of the fees paid for the subject Products, then Customer shall also pay Quest's reasonable costs of conducting the audit. This Section shall not limit or restrict any other rights or remedies of Quest that are otherwise set forth in this Agreement or available at law.
