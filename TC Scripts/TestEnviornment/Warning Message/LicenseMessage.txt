The installer did not find a Toad license key in your computer.
This may be the first time you install Toad or you may have an older type key.

It is recommended for you to enter your license key here. 
However, you may continue without the installer finding a key. 
Toad will prompt you to enter the license key upon initial launch if needed.

Note: At this time you can only enter license keys generated for Toad 10.x and above.
If you have a key generated for Toad 9.7 and below, please skip this step.
